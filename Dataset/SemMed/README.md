# Data Description

## Subject_CORD_NER.csv

The source of "Subject_CORD_NER.csv" data are the following tables from SemMed:
- PREDICATION
- PREDICATION_AUX
- SENTENCE.

"Subject_CORD_NER.csv" file contains data about genes included in CORD_NER dataset from SemMed. The data is presented in a format of semantic triples: Subject-Predicate-Object, where data for Subject columns contain genes from CORD_NER dataset, Object columns contain data for genes included in the whole bio_covid and Predication columns contain relation between these data. The whole triples (Subject, Predicate, Object) are already mapped to UMLS concepts.

Following query was used to retrieve this data from **SemMed ver 4.0 database**:

```bash
SELECT * FROM PREDICATION AS p
LEFT JOIN PREDICATION_AUX as pa
ON p.PREDICATION_ID = pa.PREDICATION_ID
LEFT JOIN SENTENCE as s
ON p.SENTENCE_ID = s.SENTENCE_ID
WHERE OBJECT_NAME IN list_of_genes_from_CORD_NER_dataset
AND
SUBJECT IN list_of_genes_in_bio_covid;
```
where list_of_genes_in_bio_covid is a list of genes previously inserted from CORD_NER dataset and list_of_genes_in_bio_covid isa list of genes previously inserted to bio_covid.



## Object_CORD_NER.csv

The source of "Object_CORD_NER.csv" data are the following tables from SemMed:
- PREDICATION
- PREDICATION_AUX
- SENTENCE.

"Object_CORD_NER.csv" file contains data about genes included in CORD_NER dataset from SemMed. The data is presented in a format of semantic triples: Subject-Predicate-Object, where data for Object columns contain genes from CORD_NER dataset, Subject columns contain data for genes included in the whole bio_covid and Predication columns contain relation between these data. The whole triples (Subject, Predicate, Object) are already mapped to UMLS concepts.

ON p.SENTENCE_ID = s.SENTENCE_ID
WHERE SUBJECT_NAME IN list_of_genes_from_CORD_NER_dataset
AND
OBJECT IN list_of_genes_in_bio_covid;
```

where list_of_genes_in_bio_covid is a list of genes previously inserted from CORD_NER dataset and list_of_genes_in_bio_covid isa list of genes previously inserted to bio_covid.
